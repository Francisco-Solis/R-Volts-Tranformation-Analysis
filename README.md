# Volts Analysis with Transformation
# Overview: 
This project analyzes the **Volts** dataset in R, using simple linear regression to examine the relationship between Voltage and time. An initial regression was fit to the raw data. However after diagnostic checks were completed, the assumptions of simple linear regression were not well satisfied. Thus, to remedy the issue, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the response variable (Volts) to improve the model fit and validity of the SLR assumptions.
